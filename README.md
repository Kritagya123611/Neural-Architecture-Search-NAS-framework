# Neural-Architecture-Search-NAS-framework
A PyTorch-based Neural Architecture Search system that automatically discovers optimal neural network architectures using reinforcement learning. AutoArch proposes network designs, builds and trains them dynamically, then learns from performance results to suggest increasingly better architectures for your specific dataset and task.
